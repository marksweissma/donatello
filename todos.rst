Fix fit_transform option in DiGraph

QA subsetting over transformations

sklearn parallelization

XGBoost cv + early stopping

collect parameter distributions from cross val

nodes in graph constructor

tests

examples
#. branching graph
#. many : 1
#. y transforms

Refactor measurements / metrics -> smooth return

Look at panel for measurement / metric organization
